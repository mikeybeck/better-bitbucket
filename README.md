# better-bitbucket
A Chrome browser plugin to improve the Bitbucket pull request experience.

I wanted to use [CSS only](https://github.com/mikeybeck/bitbucket-css), but quickly realised I wasn't going to be able to do as much as I would have liked.
So I've started this really basic plugin which simply injects some CSS & JS into the page when you click on it.

I spend a lot of time reviewing pull requests on Bitbucket, and in my opinion both the old and new PR UI's could be improved significantly.  This plugin works with the old UI only.
